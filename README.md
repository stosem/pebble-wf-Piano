What is the sound of time?
Now you can see it.

The first piano row is for showing hour. Bottom - minutes.
Black keys - for the first digit of number (ten, twenty,...). White keys - second digit (one, two,..). One octave has 7 notes (1-7) and C, D (8-9) from second one.
If no keys colorized - it means zero.
 
In screenshots it is 13:00, 7:25, 14:40

This face can also detect a watch status by showing icons:
- b (bemolle) - when bluetooth lost.
- d (eighth note) - quiet time.
- # (diesis) - on low battery.
- o (whole note) - on charging.

Support round and rectangle screen.
